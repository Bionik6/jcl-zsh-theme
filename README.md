This is a simple theme I'm using with `oh-my-zsh` which is loosely based on the theme "ys".

To install the theme `wget` the `jcl.zsh-theme` file into `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes`.

    $ cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes && wget https://raw.github.com/jasonlewis/jcl-zsh-theme/master/jcl.zsh-theme

Then set `ZSH_THEME` to `jcl` in `~/.zshrc`.
